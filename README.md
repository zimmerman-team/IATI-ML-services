# learning-sets

Models to learn latent code representation of sets being the one2many relationships within the activities (for example the activity->budget relationship). This will allow those fields to be replaced to fixed-length meaningful representation codes which ultimately will help to have fixed-length vectors of activites, for supervised (for example classification) or unsupervised learning (learning latent code representations of activities themselves)
